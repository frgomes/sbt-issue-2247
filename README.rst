SBT issue 2247
==============

https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2247 describes an issue related to configurations.

In a nutshell, the behaviour is actually expected, but it is very non intuitive for SBT users.
At this point, it's not know whether SBT will offer a more intuitive API, provide helpers or improve the documentation.

In ``build.sbt.HACKED`` we provide an example of how the difficulty can be circumvented.
